## Summary

You can see a demo of the app here: [DEMO](https://alannahw.github.io/memorymaze/)

Memory Maze is a flashcard app which combines Ebbinghaus' theory on memory loss
over time, with Leitner's set repetition to maximise study efficiency.

## The Forgetting Curve

The forgetting curve is based on Ebbinghaus’ research into memory
loss over time. The standard formula is:

R = e<sup>-t&frasl;s</sup>

Where R is memory retention, t is time, and s is strength of
memory (how well subjects performed in a test).

In theory, by revising your lists in increasing intervals over
time, you are most likely to retain the words in memory, i.e.,
your Forgetting Curve will become shallower and eventually you
will not need to revise for years.

Each list you create will have it’s own graph to track your
performance in the Game. The graph will then show your projected
forgetting curve and predict when it would be best that you next
revise the list to maintain what you have learned.

The idea is to stay above the 50% retention line on the Forgetting
Curve.

The projection is assuming you have at least 20 items in your
list, but there is no restriction on how few (or how many) you are
allowed.

## The Game

The game is a variant of the Leitner system
for learning flashcards. The game requires you to repeat each of the
list items at least three times, shown to you in random order, and
getting an answer wrong will result in that item back at zero. The
purpose is that you repeat items you struggle with more than those
you don’t, and should reduce overall study time.

Each completed Game is recorded to estimate your Forgetting Curve
and the next best revision date.
